this is the thing i want you to do this summer and that is that the sun rises from the west and you should rise from the east as this is your destiny and also mine time has come and now there is no going back 
and you cannot get what you want because it is not good for you and also for your health time will come when you will realize that whatever you did was wrong but nothing can be happened at that time tayyeba your
english is so poor that i cannot do anything about it what will happen when you will see death in front of your eyes and you
pray to have a faith in your heart who takes you through this disaster someone wants me to write a book on her life and this
is the same thought lingering in my head for so long and now my mom asked me to do that i don't know how but i have to do 
this because this is important for her and she is important for me. one day you will look back at the beautiful memories of
your childhood and you want to go back to live the moments you wondered about how cool life will be once you grow up you will
be able to use laptop mobile call others watch tv and have "freedom". there is no freedom in being grown up it is the trap 
from which you can never get out and can never be a better person than you were as a child and then you realize no one loves 
you the way they loved you when you were child and now there is no going back and i am sad and depressed for no reason may ne
being alone makes you sad but Allah is always with you you are not alone. i don't know what i am writing and why i am even 
doing this but i don't want to delete it may be sometime in life i want to see it again and laugh at my random thoughts may
be some day........... i don't know but i don't want to stop typing because it is a trans and i know i will come out of it as 
long as i stopped typing and i will go back into real life which is not so happening at the moment and when something does happen
it don't want to see it and i prefer this solitude because no matter how lonely this is still it is peaceful and peace has 
a beauty in itself and i don't know what to study i have a lot to study and writing "bongian" over here and i have eaten two
no.. three oranges and two walnuts as my breakfast and i am still feeling hungry because somehow instead of stomach a drum 
is attached to me which is never full and is never inside always bulging out showing its prescence it is more than two years 
now that i am having this problem and i am now learning to live with it as sir said should solve your problems and i am not
sure about whether i want to solve my problems or not because fear of unseen is much more than seen i have learnt to live with 
my problems and i am sure if these problems got solved new problems which are coming my way are much more than these are so 
it is better to live with these problems instead of finding new ones and again crying as there will always be something in
life to cry about i think its too much now i should stop writing and i think i never wrote something so long and spontaneous in 
my life......
thanks
bye 
see yaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
